This is a submission to Rapptr Labs React Test.

I spent nearly 14 hours building the app.

Building the login screen and styling it took me nearly 5 hours.
I did spend a lot of time resolving bugs with the app and trying to figure out how to properly make a POST request to Rapptr's API.

Building the To-do screen and styling it took me nearly 6 hours.

I spend the remaining time giving the finishing touches to styling.
